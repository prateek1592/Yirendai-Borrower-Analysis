This is an attempt at demonstrating the utility of alternate data in supplementing financial analysis of listed companies. The example chosen here is Yirendai (NYSE: YRD), a peer-to-peer online lender in the burgeoning Chinese online consumption lending sector.

The analysis was originally done in September 2017, and uses publicly available loan/borrower data gathered from Yirendai's website to estimate key parameters essential for analysis, otherwise not available in their financial statements. The key findings, observations and information about the dataset are provided in the Analysis PDF available in this repo.

Other information used was Chinese city tiers to understand geographic split of Yirendai's vast loan facilitation volume. A large portion of the data was available in Mandarin, and had to be pre-processed (a one-off) through Google Translate to obtain meaningful insights - some information might have been lost in translation.

Please note that this was an academic exercise and is not meant as any sort of financial advice. The assumptions that went into the  findings, and any subsequent errors, are mine alone.
